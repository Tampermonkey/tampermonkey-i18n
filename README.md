This repo contains Tampermonkey's locale files

Tampermonkey is a Google Chrome browser extension that allows you to write and install user scripts that enhance the functionality of your browser or of webpages you regularly visit. 

Though the browser already supports user scripts, Tampermonkey allows you to add and interact in a new way with them. It offers you an easier way of installing, customizing and managing the scripts.
