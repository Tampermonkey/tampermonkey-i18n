## contribute

If you want to contribute then this [userscript](https://gist.github.com/derjanb/5592ff3b7cdc4feabba5/raw/tampermonkey_translation_support.user.js) might help you:

After installing the script you will see a button ```Adjust to English translation``` at the button bar of each ```message.json``` file. After clicking at this button the page will be replaced by the current locale file plus all missing translations. Missing translations will be wrapped by angle bracket like this:

```
  "Dont_ask_again": {
     "message": ">>>Don't ask again<<<"
  },
```

After translating the missing content you can either create a pull request or just send me the translation to kontakt at tampermonkey.net
